title: "How I Automated AKS Security with GitHub Actions"
---

In this post, I explain how I integrated DevSecOps practices into AKS by:  

- Enabling Azure WAF for ingress traffic  
- Automating security scans in CI/CD  
- Using Terraform for consistent infra provisioning  

This approach improved security and reduced deployment errors. ðŸš€
