# 👋 Hello, I'm Balamurugan Maruthavanan  

**Senior DevSecOps Engineer | Azure | Kubernetes | Security Automation**  

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you’ll find my projects, certifications, and blog posts on cloud, DevOps, and security.

Passionate about building secure, scalable, and resilient cloud-native systems. I architect and secure cloud-native systems with a focus on Azure, Kubernetes, and end-to-end security integration. My mission: Automate security into every layer of the SDLC while enabling scalable, compliant deployments.

🔹 Core Expertise:-
  - Azure-Centric Security: Designed & deployed secure hub-spoke networks, private endpoints, and Azure-native security controls (Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, Firewall).
  - Kubernetes Hardening: Secured AKS clusters (RBAC, OPA/Gatekeeper, runtime protection).
  - Infra as Code (IaC): Terraform, repeatable deployments.
  - Shift-Left Security: Integrated SAST/DAST (Fortify) into CI/CD (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).
  - Compliance as Code: Automated Azure Policy, CIS benchmarks, and NIST SP 800-53 controls.
